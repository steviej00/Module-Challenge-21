## Synopsis

Create a fungible token called kaseiCoin (KCT) that is ERC-20 compliant for a Crowdsale contract from OpenZeppelin Solidity library. Deploy three contracts to manage the entire crowdsale process.


## Instructions
The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:

* Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract

* Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract

* Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract

* Deploy the Crowdsale to a Local Blockchain

* Optional: Extend the Crowdsale Contract by Using OpenZeppelin

## Requirements
This project leverages python version 3.7.11 with the following packages and modules:

- Solidity - Create a contract and included the joints saving file to work with ether.

- Remix IDE - Write solidity code to create smart contracts

- MetaMask - Use digital wallet to transfer and share tokens on Ethereum blockchain.

- Ganache - Testing tool used for smart contracts.

- OpenZeppelin - OpenZeppelin library provides an array of contracts that included various ERC token standards.
